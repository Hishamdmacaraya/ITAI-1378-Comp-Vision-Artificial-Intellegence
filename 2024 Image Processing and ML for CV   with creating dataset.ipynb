    "### What is SVM (Support Vector Machine)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. However, it is mostly used for classification problems. The objective of the SVM algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space (N is the number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hyperplane:** A decision boundary that separates different classes in the feature space. In 2D, it's a line; in 3D, it's a plane.\n",
    "- **Support Vectors:** Data points that are closest to the hyperplane and influence its position and orientation. These points help in maximizing the margin of the classifier.\n",
    "- **Margin:** The distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from either class. SVM aims to maximize this margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use SVM?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Effective in high-dimensional spaces:** SVM is very effective when the number of features is large.\n",
    "- **Memory efficient:** It uses a subset of training points (support vectors) in the decision function, making it memory efficient.\n",
    "- **Versatile:** Different kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels include linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does `SVC(kernel='linear')` mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "`SVC` stands for Support Vector Classification, which is a class in the Scikit-Learn library used to implement the SVM algorithm for classification tasks. The `kernel` parameter in the `SVC` class specifies the type of hyperplane used to separate the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kernel Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear Kernel:** The data is linearly separable (i.e., a straight line or hyperplane can separate the data). This is the simplest kernel.\n",
    "  - When we use `SVC(kernel='linear')`, it means we are using a linear kernel for our SVM. This kernel is appropriate when the data can be separated by a straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions).\n",
    "- **Polynomial Kernel:** The data is not linearly separable, but a polynomial function of the input features can separate the data.\n",
    "- **Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel:** The data is not linearly separable, but mapping the data into a higher-dimensional space using a Gaussian (RBF) function can separate the data.\n",
    "\n",
